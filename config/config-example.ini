; Threading
;------------------

; threading can improve performance of your application. it
; allows modules to push blocking work onto another processes,
; this can also improve stability, because timeouts or
; unexpected exceptions do not impact the main application.

; if you have stability problems try to deactivate threading first
threading.enabled = false

; how long may a thread be busy until it is killed
; threading.busy_timeout = 20

; how long, if not busy, may it take for a thread to response to a ping
; threading.ping_timeout = 2

; how many jobs should be send on each loop.
; increasing this value will boost jobs/time
; decreasing it will result in a reaction time improvement.
; threading.chunk_size = 10

; if threading is disabled, then how much time should be spend on
; each application loop to process work that would have been assigned
; to other threads normally
; default value is 1 second.
; threading.sequential_timeout = 1
